# timeasy

A simple time tracker application.

## Getting Started

### Application icon

For setting the application icon the package "flutter_launcher_icons"
(https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons) is used. The configuration can be found in the
pubspec.yaml.

Just place your icon in the path configured in the pubspec.yaml and run

flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
