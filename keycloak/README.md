# Keycloak Authentication

The authentication is done by Keycloak. You can use this docker-compose fpor testing. There's also a realm-export.json in this directory that you can use to
import the realm into you Keycloak installation.

Remember to set the client secrets for the client "timeasy-server" correctly.
